# 📁 The `images/` Folder

This folder is where you should store **all image files** used in your website. Keeping all images in one place helps keep your project organized and makes it easier to reference them in your HTML and CSS files.

---

## ✅ What Belongs Here

Store **only images** that are used in your website, such as:
- Page banners, logos, and icons  
- Backgrounds and patterns  
- Photos for articles, galleries, or profiles  
- Decorative or supporting images for your layout

## 📷 Accepted File Types

You may include common web image formats:

| File Type | Use Case | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| `.jpg` / `.jpeg` | Photos and complex images | Use for images with many colors. |
| `.png` | Graphics, logos, or transparent images | Supports transparency. |
| `.gif` | Simple animations | Keep file sizes small. |
| `.svg` | Icons or vector graphics | Scales cleanly at any size. |
| `.webp` | Optimized images (optional) | Modern format with good compression. |

Avoid including non-image files (e.g., PDFs, Word docs, ZIPs) in this folder.

## 🧾 File Naming Guidelines

- Use **descriptive, lowercase names** (e.g., `header-logo.png`, `profile-photo.jpg`).
- Avoid spaces — use **hyphens or underscores** instead.  
  Example: `banner_image.jpg` or `banner-image.jpg`
- Keep filenames short but meaningful.
- Do not include punctuation or special characters.

## 🧩 Referencing Images in HTML

From your HTML file, reference images with **relative paths**:
```html
<img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="Sample photo">
